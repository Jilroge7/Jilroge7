### I'm a full-stack software engineering student with Holberton School in Tulsa, and graduation is January 2022! My passion falls into the UX/UI design, I love seeing a project come to life while flexing my creative muscle. You may also find me in the kitchen, because I looove cooking. If I find something I love in a restaurant, you better believe I'm gonna find a way to recreate it at home!
